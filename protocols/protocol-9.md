## 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### 1.1 The Opioid Crisis and Emergency Department Encounters

The United States continues to face an unprecedented opioid overdose crisis, with over 107,000 drug overdose deaths in 2021, of which approximately 75% involved opioids. Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) frequently present to Emergency Departments (EDs) for various reasons, including acute withdrawal, overdose, infections, and injuries. These ED visits represent critical opportunities—"reachable moments"—to initiate evidence-based treatment for OUD. However, the traditional approach of "screening and referral to treatment" has proven largely ineffective, with less than 10% of referred patients successfully engaging in addiction treatment.

Emergency Departments are uniquely positioned to initiate treatment for OUD. They operate 24/7, serve as healthcare safety nets for vulnerable populations, and often encounter patients with OUD who are not engaged with the healthcare system in other ways. Moreover, patients presenting to the ED with complications of OUD may be particularly receptive to treatment initiation due to the immediate consequences of their substance use.

### 1.2 Buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), particularly methadone and buprenorphine, are the gold standard treatment for OUD. These medications reduce mortality, illicit opioid use, infectious disease transmission, and criminal activity while improving social functioning and treatment retention. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, has several advantages that make it suitable for ED initiation:

1. Favorable safety profile with a "ceiling effect" on respiratory depression
2. Lower abuse potential compared to full opioid agonists
3. Long half-life allowing for once-daily dosing
4. Ability to be prescribed in office-based settings (vs. methadone's restriction to licensed opioid treatment programs)
5. Effective management of opioid withdrawal symptoms
6. Blockade of the euphoric effects of other opioids

Recent regulatory changes have expanded access to buprenorphine, with the elimination of the DATA 2000 X-waiver requirement in December 2022. This change allows all DEA-registered practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD without additional certification, removing a significant barrier to ED-initiated treatment.

### 1.3 Evidence for Emergency Department-Initiated Buprenorphine

A landmark study by D'Onofrio and colleagues (2015) demonstrated that ED-initiated buprenorphine significantly increased engagement in addiction treatment (78% vs. 37% in referral group) and reduced illicit opioid use at 30 days compared to referral alone. Subsequent studies have confirmed these findings and suggested potential benefits for reducing repeat ED visits and hospital admissions.

However, several gaps in knowledge remain:

1. The effectiveness of ED-initiated buprenorphine in diverse settings and populations
2. Optimal methods for supporting the transition from ED initiation to continued community-based treatment
3. Impact on longer-term outcomes such as sustained recovery, healthcare utilization, and overdose risk
4. Cost-effectiveness and implementation considerations

### 1.4 Barriers to Implementation and Navigation Support

Despite compelling evidence, implementation of ED-initiated buprenorphine has been limited by several barriers:

1. Provider knowledge and comfort with buprenorphine initiation
2. Concerns about withdrawal precipitation
3. Time constraints in busy ED settings
4. Limited access to rapid follow-up for continued treatment
5. Complex social and structural factors affecting patient ability to access continued care

Peer recovery navigators—individuals with lived experience of substance use disorder and recovery who have received specialized training—have emerged as a promising approach to address these barriers. Peer navigators can provide support, motivation, and practical assistance to help patients bridge the gap between ED initiation and continued community treatment. Preliminary studies suggest that peer navigation can significantly improve treatment engagement and retention rates.

### 1.5 Low-Threshold Treatment Models

Traditional MOUD treatment programs often involve significant barriers to entry and retention, including frequent mandatory visits, strict attendance policies, required counseling, and zero-tolerance approaches to continued substance use. These high-threshold models may be particularly challenging for vulnerable patients with multiple social and structural barriers to care.

Low-threshold treatment models aim to reduce these barriers by:
- Offering same-day or next-day treatment entry
- Minimizing requirements for continued participation
- Taking a harm reduction approach to ongoing substance use
- Providing flexible scheduling
- Addressing social determinants of health
- Meeting patients "where they are" in their recovery journey

These models have shown promise in engaging and retaining patients who may not succeed in traditional treatment settings. Connecting ED-initiated buprenorphine patients to low-threshold continuation treatment may further improve outcomes by addressing both initial engagement and longer-term retention challenges.

### 1.6 Rationale for Current Study

This study aims to address current knowledge gaps by evaluating the effectiveness of ED-initiated buprenorphine with peer navigator support compared to enhanced referral to treatment in a large, diverse sample across multiple sites. The study will examine not only initial treatment engagement but also longer-term outcomes including ongoing substance use, healthcare utilization, overdose rates, and quality of life measures. By incorporating peer navigators and low-threshold treatment models, this study tests a comprehensive approach designed to overcome common barriers to successful linkage and retention in care.

The findings from this study will inform clinical practice, healthcare policy, and implementation efforts aimed at expanding access to evidence-based OUD treatment through emergency department settings. As a component of the NIH HEAL Initiative, this research directly addresses the urgent need for effective strategies to reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality through expanded treatment access.

## 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES

### 2.1 Primary Objective

## 3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN

### 3.1 Overall Study Design

This is a multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial comparing Emergency Department (ED)-initiated buprenorphine with peer navigator support to enhanced referral to treatment (enhanced usual care) for patients with opioid use disorder. The study will enroll 1,000 participants (500 per arm) across six hospital Emergency Departments in California.

Eligible participants will be identified during their ED visit, consented, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention or control arm. All participants will complete baseline assessments and be followed for 180 days post-randomization, with assessments at 30, 90, and 180 days.

### 3.2 Study Sites

The study will be conducted at six Emergency Departments:

1. Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA
2. UCLA Medical Center Santa Monica, Santa Monica, CA
3. UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus, San Francisco, CA
4. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA
5. Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA
6. Highland Hospital, Oakland, CA

These sites represent a diverse range of ED settings, including academic medical centers, safety-net hospitals, urban and suburban locations, and varied patient populations, enhancing the generalizability of study findings.

### 3.3 Timeline

- **Year 1 (Months 1-12)**: Protocol finalization, IRB approval, staff hiring and training, site preparation, and initiation of enrollment
- **Years 1-3 (Months 3-36)**: Participant enrollment and intervention delivery
- **Years 1-4 (Months 3-48)**: Follow-up assessments
- **Years 4-5 (Months 37-60)**: Completion of data collection, data analysis, manuscript preparation, and dissemination

### 3.4 Randomization

Eligible participants who provide informed consent will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention arm (ED-initiated buprenorphine with peer navigator support) or the control arm (enhanced referral to treatment). Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated allocation sequence with permuted blocks of variable size, stratified by site and prior MOUD treatment history (yes/no).

The randomization process will be implemented through a secure web-based system that will ensure allocation concealment until after enrollment. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of participants and providers is not feasible. However, outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment assignment when possible.

## 8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 8.1 Sample Size Determination

The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome of engagement in formal addiction treatment at 30 days post-randomization. Based on previous studies, we estimate that:
- 15% of participants in the enhanced referral arm will be engaged in treatment at 30 days
- 30% of participants in the intervention arm will be engaged in treatment at 30 days

With these assumptions, a sample size of 436 participants (218 per arm) would provide 90% power to detect this difference using a two-sided chi-square test with alpha=0.05. To account for up to 15% loss to follow-up and to ensure adequate power for secondary analyses, we will enroll 500 participants per arm (1,000 total).

This sample size will also provide adequate power for key secondary outcomes:
- >80% power to detect a 15% difference in illicit opioid use
- >80% power to detect a 20% reduction in ED visits
- >80% power to detect clinically meaningful differences in quality of life measures

### 8.2 Statistical Analysis Plan

All primary analyses will follow the intent-to-treat principle, including all randomized participants regardless of protocol adherence. Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of missing data and protocol deviations.

#### 8.2.2 Primary Outcome Analysis

The primary outcome (engagement in formal addiction treatment at 30 days) will be analyzed using logistic regression with treatment group as the primary independent variable. The model will adjust for stratification factors (site and prior MOUD history) and key baseline characteristics (age, gender, housing status, primary opioid type).

#### 8.2.3 Secondary Outcome Analyses

**Illicit Opioid Use:**
- Logistic regression for binary outcome (any use vs. no use)
- Negative binomial regression for count of days using

**Treatment Retention:**
- Logistic regression for retention at specific time points
- Survival analysis for time to treatment dropout

**Healthcare Utilization:**
- Negative binomial regression for count outcomes (number of ED visits, hospitalizations)
- Linear regression for continuous outcomes (length of stay)

**Overdose Events:**
- Logistic regression for binary outcome (any overdose vs. none)
- Survival analysis for time to first overdose

**Quality of Life:**
- Linear mixed-effects models to account for repeated measures

**Economic Analyses:**
- Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculation
- Sensitivity analyses with varied assumptions
- Bootstrapping for confidence intervals

#### 8.2.4 Subgroup Analyses

Pre-specified subgroup analyses will examine treatment effects by:
- Site

- Prior MOUD treatment history
- Polysubstance use
- Presence of co-occurring psychiatric conditions

#### 8.2.5 Missing Data

Primary analyses will use multiple imputation to address missing data, under the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of different missing data assumptions, including:
- Complete case analysis
- Last observation carried forward
- Pattern-mixture models for non-ignorable missing data
