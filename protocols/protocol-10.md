## 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

### 1.1 Background

Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans and is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care. For decades, prescription opioids have been a mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe chronic pain. However, long-term opioid therapy is associated with significant risks, including tolerance, physical dependence, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, addiction, overdose, and death. The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need for effective non-pharmacological approaches to pain management and strategies to reduce opioid use while maintaining or improving pain control.

Current best practices for chronic pain emphasize multimodal approaches that combine pharmacological treatments with physical, psychological, and integrative interventions. However, many evidence-based non-pharmacological treatments face barriers to implementation, including limited access, high costs, time constraints, and patient reluctance. Novel, engaging, accessible interventions are needed to expand the options available for pain management and opioid dose reduction.

### 1.2 Virtual Reality for Pain Management

Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology with significant potential for pain management. VR creates an immersive, multi-sensory, three-dimensional environment that can engage multiple cortical areas involved in pain processing. By creating a sense of presence and immersion in a virtual world, VR can redirect attention away from pain, modulate emotional responses to pain, and potentially activate endogenous pain modulatory systems.

The mechanisms by which VR may impact chronic pain include:

1. **Distraction**: VR can provide powerful engagement that diverts attention away from pain processing
2. **Modulation of emotion**: VR environments can elicit positive emotions that may counter pain-related negative affect
3. **Increased self-efficacy**: Success in virtual activities may enhance patients' confidence in their ability to control pain
4. **Neuroplasticity**: Regular VR use may promote adaptive changes in pain processing networks
5. **Relaxation and stress reduction**: Meditative and calming VR environments may reduce sympathetic arousal
6. **Graded exposure to activity**: VR can provide safe opportunities to engage in movements that patients may otherwise avoid due to pain or fear

### 1.3 Previous Research

Early research on VR for acute procedural pain demonstrated large effect sizes for reducing pain intensity and distress during painful medical procedures. More recently, studies have begun to examine VR for chronic pain conditions:

- A pilot RCT (n=30) testing an 8-week home-based VR program for chronic low back pain found significant reductions in pain intensity (mean difference: 1.5 points on a 0-10 scale) and pain interference compared to an education control group (Garcia et al., 2021).

- A single-arm study (n=20) of VR for fibromyalgia found clinically significant improvements in pain intensity and function, with effects persisting at 3-month follow-up (Thompson et al., 2020).

- A feasibility study (n=25) of a VR-based program combining meditation, cognitive therapy, and graded exposure for chronic pain demonstrated high adherence (82% session completion) and significant improvements in pain catastrophizing (Lee et al., 2019).

- A case series (n=10) of patients with chronic pain on long-term opioid therapy reported that regular VR use was associated with voluntary reductions in opioid dose (mean reduction: 17%) over a 12-week period (Williams et al., 2022).

These preliminary findings suggest that VR may be a promising approach for chronic pain management and potentially for supporting opioid dose reduction. However, larger, more rigorous studies are needed to establish efficacy, identify appropriate candidates, determine optimal "dosing," and evaluate long-term outcomes.

### 1.4 Rationale for Current Study

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an immersive VR intervention for reducing opioid doses in patients with chronic pain who are on long-term opioid therapy. The VR program has been specifically designed for chronic pain management, incorporating evidence-based psychological approaches (cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy) with engaging, immersive content that aims to address multiple dimensions of the chronic pain experience.

The study addresses several gaps in the current literature:

1. **Focus on opioid reduction**: While previous studies have examined VR for pain intensity reduction, few have specifically targeted opioid dose reduction as a primary outcome.

2. **Home-based delivery**: Most prior VR studies were conducted in clinic settings. This study will examine the effectiveness of a home-based VR program that could dramatically expand access to this intervention.

3. **Rigorous control condition**: This study employs a sham VR control to account for non-specific effects and participant expectations.

4. **Larger sample and longer follow-up**: With 360 participants and a 24-week follow-up period, this study will provide more definitive evidence regarding effectiveness and durability of effects.

5. **Diverse chronic pain conditions**: By including patients with various chronic pain conditions, this study will help identify whether VR is more effective for certain pain types.

If proven effective, VR could represent a scalable, engaging, non-pharmacological approach to help address the dual public health challenges of chronic pain and opioid misuse.

## 9. STATISTICS

### 9.1 Sample Size and Power

The primary outcome is percent change in daily opioid dose (MME) from baseline to 8 weeks. Based on preliminary data and previous studies, we anticipate:
- Mean reduction in opioid dose in the sham VR group: 5% (SD: 15%)
- Mean reduction in opioid dose in the immersive VR group: 15% (SD: 25%)
- Effect size (Cohen's d): 0.48

With these assumptions, a sample size of 144 participants (72 per arm) would provide 90% power to detect this difference using a two-sided t-test with alpha=0.05. To account for up to 20% attrition, we will enroll 180 participants per arm (360 total).

This sample size will also provide adequate power (>80%) for key secondary outcomes:
- 1.0-point difference in pain intensity (NRS)
- 5-point difference in PROMIS Pain Interference
- 6-point difference in Pain Catastrophizing Scale

### 9.2 Analysis Populations

**Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population**:
- All randomized participants, regardless of protocol adherence
- Primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses

**Per-Protocol (PP) Population**:
- Participants who completed at least 75% of prescribed VR sessions and all major assessments
- Used for sensitivity analyses

**Safety Population**:
- All participants who received the assigned intervention and completed at least one post-baseline assessment
- Used for safety analyses

### 9.3 Statistical Analysis Plan

#### 9.3.1 Primary Outcome Analysis

The primary analysis will compare percent change in daily opioid dose from baseline to 8 weeks between the immersive VR and sham VR groups using a linear mixed-effects model. The model will include fixed effects for treatment group, time, treatment-by-time interaction, and stratification factors (site and baseline opioid dose category), with a random effect for participant to account for repeated measures.

The primary contrast of interest will be the between-group difference at 8 weeks. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation under the missing at random (MAR) assumption.

#### 9.3.2 Secondary Outcome Analyses

Continuous secondary outcomes (e.g., pain intensity, pain interference, psychological measures) will be analyzed using similar linear mixed-effects models.

For binary outcomes, generalized linear mixed models with a logit link function will be used.

All secondary analyses will follow the same approach as the primary analysis, with appropriate transformations as needed to meet model assumptions.

#### 9.3.3 Exploratory Analyses

**Moderator Analyses**:
- Interaction terms will be added to the primary outcome model to test whether treatment effects vary by:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Pain condition
  - Pain duration
  - Baseline opioid dose
  - Baseline pain catastrophizing
  - Technology familiarity

**Mediator Analyses**:
- Structural equation modeling to test whether changes in potential mediators (pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, emotional distress) account for treatment effects on opioid dose reduction

**Engagement Analyses**:
- Correlation and regression analyses to examine relationships between VR engagement metrics and clinical outcomes

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**:
- Calculation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the difference in costs between immersive VR and sham VR divided by the difference in QALYs
- Sensitivity analyses with varied cost assumptions
- Bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals for the ICER

#### 9.3.4 Handling of Missing Data

The primary analysis approach using mixed-effects models can accommodate missing data under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. To address potential bias from missing data, the following approaches will be used:
- Multiple imputation for outcomes with substantial missing data (>10%)
- Sensitivity analyses under different missing data assumptions
- Collection of reasons for dropout to inform missing data models

### 9.4 Interim Analyses

No formal interim analyses for efficacy are planned. The DSMB will review enrollment, retention, and safety data every 6 months and may recommend modifications to the study if safety concerns arise.
