## 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### 1.1 Disease Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. Despite advances in treatment options, the prognosis for patients with advanced NSCLC remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% for stage IV disease. Current standard first-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC without targetable mutations includes platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. However, most patients will eventually develop progressive disease.

### 1.2 Investigational Agent
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. By blocking this interaction, pembrolizumab releases the PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.

### 1.3 Rationale
Pembrolizumab has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor types, including NSCLC. Preliminary data from the KEYNOTE-001 study showed an objective response rate of approximately 19% in patients with previously treated NSCLC, with higher response rates observed in patients with high PD-L1 expression. Based on these promising results, further evaluation of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy is warranted.

## 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES

### 2.1 Primary Objective
- To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy

### 2.2 Secondary Objectives
- To assess progression-free survival (PFS)
- To assess overall survival (OS)
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in this patient population
- To evaluate duration of response (DOR)

### 2.3 Exploratory Objectives
- To evaluate potential biomarkers of response to pembrolizumab, including PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden
- To assess quality of life measures using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaires

## 6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS

### 6.1 Efficacy Assessments
Tumor assessments will be performed by computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at baseline and every 9 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. Response will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 criteria.

### 6.2 Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, ECOG performance status, 12-lead ECGs, and laboratory evaluations. Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0.

### 6.3 Biomarker Assessments
PD-L1 expression will be assessed in tumor samples using an FDA-approved immunohistochemistry assay. Additional exploratory biomarker analyses, including tumor mutational burden, may be performed.

### 6.4 Quality of Life Assessments
Quality of life will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaires at baseline and every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression or treatment discontinuation.

## 7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 7.1 Sample Size Determination
A total of 120 patients will be enrolled in this study. With this sample size, the study will have 90% power to detect an improvement in ORR from 10% (historical control) to 22% (expected with pembrolizumab) at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025.

### 7.2 Analysis Populations
- Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: All enrolled patients
- Safety population: All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug
- Per-protocol (PP) population: All patients in the ITT population who have no major protocol violations

### 7.3 Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint, ORR, will be calculated as the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. ORR will be reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.

PFS and OS will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median PFS and OS will be reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

Safety data will be summarized descriptively. The incidence, severity, and relationship to study drug of adverse events will be tabulated.
