## PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS

**Protocol Title**: A Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of LentiGlobin™ BB305 Gene Therapy in Subjects with Severe Sickle Cell Disease

**Protocol Number**: SCGT-2023-301

**Study Phase**: III

**Study Rationale**:
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin that causes red blood cells to become sickle-shaped, leading to vaso-occlusion, chronic pain, organ damage, and premature death. Current treatments are limited and do not address the underlying genetic cause of the disease. LentiGlobin™ BB305 is a lentiviral vector-based gene therapy designed to add functional copies of a modified β-globin gene into a patient's own hematopoietic stem cells, potentially enabling production of anti-sickling hemoglobin that can decrease sickle hemoglobin polymerization and red blood cell sickling.

**Study Objectives**:

*Primary Objective*:
- To evaluate the efficacy of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy in reducing the frequency of severe vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in subjects with severe SCD

*Secondary Objectives*:
- To evaluate the effect of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy on hemoglobin levels
- To evaluate the effect of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy on hemolysis markers
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy
- To evaluate the effect of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy on healthcare resource utilization
- To evaluate the effect of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy on patient-reported outcomes

*Exploratory Objectives*:
- To evaluate the durability of response to LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy
- To evaluate the impact of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy on organ damage
- To identify potential biomarkers of response to LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy

**Study Design**:
This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy in subjects with severe SCD. A total of 150 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy or placebo. The study will consist of a screening period, a mobilization and apheresis period, a conditioning period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. The total duration of the study will be 24 months from the time of gene therapy infusion.

**Study Population**:
Adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 to 50 years with severe SCD (HbSS, HbSβ0, or HbSβ+ genotypes) who have had at least 4 severe VOCs in the 24 months prior to enrollment.

**Number of Subjects**:
150 subjects (100 in the LentiGlobin™ BB305 group and 50 in the placebo group)

**Number of Sites**:
Approximately 30 sites in the United States, Europe, and Africa

**Treatment Groups**:
- LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy: Autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transduced with BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified β-globin gene
- Placebo: Autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells not transduced with BB305 lentiviral vector

**Duration of Treatment**:
Single administration of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy or placebo following myeloablative conditioning with busulfan

**Duration of Study**:
24 months from the time of gene therapy infusion

## 1. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE

### 1.1 Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited blood disorders characterized by the presence of sickle hemoglobin (HbS), which polymerizes when deoxygenated, leading to red blood cell (RBC) sickling, hemolysis, and vaso-occlusion. SCD affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States and millions worldwide, with a particularly high prevalence in individuals of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian descent.

The clinical manifestations of SCD are diverse and can affect multiple organ systems. Acute complications include painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), acute chest syndrome, stroke, and splenic sequestration. Chronic complications include pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, avascular necrosis, leg ulcers, and cumulative end-organ damage. The life expectancy of individuals with SCD is significantly reduced compared to the general population, with a median age of death in the United States of approximately 45 years for males and 48 years for females with HbSS disease.

Current treatment options for SCD are limited. Hydroxyurea, the first FDA-approved drug for SCD, increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production and reduces the frequency of painful crises, acute chest syndrome, and the need for blood transfusions. However, approximately 25-50% of patients do not respond adequately to hydroxyurea. Voxelotor and crizanlizumab were recently approved for SCD, but these treatments also do not address the underlying genetic cause of the disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy currently available, but it is limited by donor availability and the risk of transplant-related complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Gene therapy offers a promising approach for the treatment of SCD. By adding functional copies of a modified β-globin gene into a patient's own hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), gene therapy has the potential to enable production of anti-sickling hemoglobin that can decrease HbS polymerization and RBC sickling, thereby addressing the underlying pathophysiology of the disease.

### 1.2 Preclinical Studies

The BB305 lentiviral vector used in LentiGlobin™ gene therapy contains a modified β-globin gene (βA-T87Q) that not only provides functional β-globin chains but also confers anti-sickling properties. The βA-T87Q gene produces hemoglobin (HbAT87Q) that can be distinguished from normal adult hemoglobin (HbA) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), allowing for specific quantification of vector-derived hemoglobin production.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the BB305 lentiviral vector in various models. In vitro studies have shown efficient transduction of human CD34+ HSCs with the BB305 vector, resulting in stable expression of the βA-T87Q gene and production of HbAT87Q. In vivo studies in murine models of SCD have demonstrated reduced red blood cell sickling, improved hematological parameters, and amelioration of SCD-related organ damage following treatment with autologous HSCs transduced with the BB305 vector.

Safety studies have shown no evidence of insertional oncogenesis or other vector-related adverse events in long-term follow-up studies in animals. Integration site analysis has demonstrated a polyclonal pattern of vector integration, with no evidence of clonal dominance or preferential integration near oncogenes.

### 1.3 Clinical Studies

LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy has been evaluated in several clinical studies in patients with SCD. In the Phase I/II HGB-206 study, 25 patients with severe SCD received LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy following myeloablative conditioning with busulfan. The study demonstrated production of HbAT87Q at levels sufficient to reduce the frequency of severe VOCs, with a complete elimination of severe VOCs in the majority of patients who had at least 12 months of follow-up. The treatment was generally well-tolerated, with no vector-related adverse events reported.

The promising results from the HGB-206 study led to the design of this Phase III study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy in a larger population of patients with severe SCD.

### 1.4 Study Rationale

This Phase III study aims to confirm the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy in patients with severe SCD. The primary endpoint of the study is the reduction in the frequency of severe VOCs, which are a major cause of morbidity and healthcare resource utilization in patients with SCD. Secondary endpoints include improvements in hemoglobin levels, reduction in hemolysis markers, and improvements in patient-reported outcomes, which are important measures of disease severity and quality of life in patients with SCD.

The inclusion of a placebo control group is essential to rigorously assess the efficacy of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy. The placebo group will undergo the same procedures as the treatment group, including mobilization, apheresis, and myeloablative conditioning, but will receive autologous CD34+ HSCs that have not been transduced with the BB305 vector. This design will allow for direct comparison of the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy versus placebo in a randomized, double-blind setting.

### 1.5 Risk/Benefit Assessment

The potential benefits of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy for patients with severe SCD include reduction in the frequency of severe VOCs, improvement in hemoglobin levels, reduction in hemolysis, and potential improvement in long-term outcomes. The Phase I/II HGB-206 study demonstrated promising results, with complete elimination of severe VOCs in the majority of patients who had at least 12 months of follow-up.

The potential risks of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy include risks associated with mobilization and apheresis, myeloablative conditioning, and the gene therapy itself. Mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been associated with an increased risk of VOCs in patients with SCD; therefore, plerixafor will be used for mobilization in this study. Myeloablative conditioning with busulfan carries risks including myelosuppression, infection, bleeding, mucositis, and potential long-term effects such as infertility and secondary malignancies. Risks specific to gene therapy include the potential for insertional oncogenesis, although no cases have been reported in clinical studies of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy to date.

Given the severity of SCD, the limited efficacy of current treatments, and the promising results from the Phase I/II HGB-206 study, the potential benefits of LentiGlobin™ BB305 gene therapy are considered to outweigh the potential risks for patients with severe SCD.
