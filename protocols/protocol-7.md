## 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### 1.1 The Opioid Overdose Crisis

The United States continues to face an unprecedented opioid overdose crisis, with over 107,000 drug overdose deaths occurring in 2021, of which approximately 75% involved opioids. The crisis has evolved through several phases: beginning with prescription opioid misuse in the late 1990s, transitioning to increased heroin use in the 2010s, and most recently characterized by the proliferation of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogs. This evolution has presented significant challenges for public health intervention efforts.

Philadelphia has been particularly impacted by the opioid crisis, with overdose death rates substantially higher than the national average. In 2022, Philadelphia reported 1,413 unintentional drug overdose deaths, with opioids present in over 85% of cases. Certain neighborhoods, especially in the Kensington area, have experienced disproportionately high rates of fatal and non-fatal overdoses, creating "hotspots" that strain local resources and devastate communities.

### 1.2 Overdose Prevention Strategies

Several evidence-based strategies have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing opioid overdose mortality:

1. **Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND)**: Community-based naloxone distribution programs have been associated with reduced overdose mortality in multiple observational studies. Systematic reviews indicate that OEND programs are feasible, effective, and cost-effective interventions.

2. **Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)**: Methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone significantly reduce mortality and improve outcomes for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, only about 20% of individuals with OUD receive these evidence-based treatments, due to barriers including stigma, limited availability, and restrictive policies.

3. **Harm Reduction Services**: Syringe services programs, safe consumption sites, and other harm reduction approaches have been shown to reduce infectious disease transmission, increase engagement with healthcare services, and potentially reduce overdose risk.

4. **Post-Overdose Interventions**: Outreach to individuals following a non-fatal overdose represents a critical intervention opportunity. Programs that engage individuals during this "reachable moment" have shown promise in linking people to treatment and reducing repeat overdoses.

5. **Community-Based Approaches**: Multi-component community interventions that address multiple levels of the socio-ecological model have demonstrated effectiveness for other public health issues but have been insufficiently studied for opioid overdose prevention.

### 1.3 Gaps in Current Approaches

Despite the availability of effective individual strategies, significant gaps remain in current approaches to the overdose crisis:

1. **Limited Integration**: Interventions are often implemented in isolation rather than as coordinated, comprehensive programs.

2. **Structural Barriers**: Multiple barriers impede access to evidence-based prevention and treatment, including stigma, lack of insurance, transportation challenges, and complex healthcare systems.

3. **Insufficient Scale**: Interventions frequently fail to reach sufficient scale to impact population-level outcomes.

4. **Limited Community Engagement**: Many programs are developed without meaningful input from affected communities and fail to address local contexts and needs.

5. **Inadequate Attention to Social Determinants**: Underlying social and structural factors contributing to overdose risk are often neglected.

### 1.4 Rationale for Current Study

This study aims to address these gaps by implementing and evaluating a comprehensive, integrated community-based overdose prevention and response program. The intervention incorporates multiple evidence-based strategies, addresses barriers at multiple levels, emphasizes community engagement, and aims to achieve sufficient scale to impact population-level outcomes.

The stepped-wedge cluster randomized design allows for rigorous evaluation while ensuring that all communities eventually receive the intervention. This design also enables examination of implementation factors that influence effectiveness across different community contexts.

The NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative has identified community-based approaches to the overdose crisis as a key research priority. This study directly responds to this priority by testing a comprehensive model that could be adapted and scaled to other communities if proven effective.

## 3. STUDY DESIGN

### 3.1 Overall Design

This study will employ a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design, in which 10 zip code areas in Philadelphia with high rates of opioid overdose deaths will be randomized to receive the intervention at different time points over a 30-month period. All clusters will begin in the control condition, and clusters will cross over to the intervention condition in a randomized sequence at 6-month intervals.

The stepped-wedge design is appropriate for this study because:
- It ensures that all communities eventually receive the intervention, addressing ethical concerns about withholding potentially beneficial services.
- It allows for comparison of outcomes between intervention and control periods within the same communities, controlling for community-specific factors.
- It facilitates evaluation of temporal trends and duration effects.
- It enables pragmatic, sequential implementation that aligns with capacity constraints.

### 3.2 Study Timeline

The 5-year study will proceed as follows:

**Year 1 (Planning Phase):**
- Months 1-6: Community engagement, needs assessment, and intervention refinement
- Months 7-12: Staff recruitment and training, infrastructure development, baseline data collection

**Years 2-4 (Implementation Phase):**
- Months 13-18: Cluster 1 crosses over to intervention
- Months 19-24: Clusters 1-2 receiving intervention
- Months 25-30: Clusters 1-3 receiving intervention
- Months 31-36: Clusters 1-4 receiving intervention
- Months 37-42: Clusters 1-5 receiving intervention
- Months 43-48: All clusters (1-10) receiving intervention

**Year 5 (Follow-up and Analysis Phase):**
- Months 49-54: Final data collection and follow-up
- Months 55-60: Data analysis, dissemination, and reporting

### 3.3 Randomization

The 10 zip code clusters will be randomized to one of 5 sequences for crossover from control to intervention condition. Randomization will be stratified by baseline overdose rate (high vs. medium) and geographic location (North/Northeast, South/Southwest, West) to ensure balance across sequences.

The randomization will be performed using a computer-generated algorithm by the study statistician, who is not involved in intervention delivery. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of communities or implementation staff is not feasible.

### 3.4 Study Setting

The study will be conducted in 10 zip code areas in Philadelphia, selected based on the following criteria:
- High rate of opioid overdose deaths (above city median)
- Geographic distribution across the city
- Presence of community organizations willing to partner
- Variability in demographic and socioeconomic characteristics

The selected zip codes encompass approximately 35% of Philadelphia's population and account for approximately 65% of the city's opioid overdose deaths.

## 4. STUDY POPULATION

### 4.1 Target Population

The intervention will target residents of the selected zip code areas, with particular focus on individuals at high risk for opioid overdose, including:
- Persons who use opioids non-medically (both injection and non-injection use)
- Individuals with history of opioid overdose
- Persons recently released from incarceration with history of opioid use
- Patients discharged from emergency departments or hospitals following overdose
- Individuals discontinuing or tapering from prescribed opioids
- Household members and social contacts of the above groups

### 4.2 Eligibility for Program Components

- **Quarterly Assessments:** Implementation fidelity, program adaptation
- **Annual Assessments:** Community surveys, cost data, healthcare utilization

## 7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

### 7.1 Sample Size and Power

Power calculations are based on the primary outcome of opioid overdose mortality rate. Based on historical data, we assume:
- Baseline rate of 60 overdose deaths per 100,000 population annually
- Average population of 30,000 per zip code cluster
- Intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05
- Stepped-wedge design with 10 clusters and 5 steps

With these assumptions, the study will have 80% power to detect a 20% reduction in overdose mortality (from 60 to 48 per 100,000) with a two-sided alpha of 0.05.

### 7.2 Analysis Plan

#### 7.2.1 Primary Analysis

The primary analysis will use a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a Poisson distribution and log link function to compare overdose mortality rates between intervention and control periods. The model will include:
- Fixed effect for intervention status (intervention vs. control)
- Fixed effect for time period
- Random effect for cluster (zip code)
- Adjustment for baseline overdose rate
- Offset term for population size

#### 7.2.2 Secondary Analyses

Similar GLMMs will be used for count outcomes (e.g., non-fatal overdoses, ED visits). Linear mixed models will be used for continuous outcomes (e.g., knowledge scores). All models will account for the stepped-wedge design and include appropriate adjustments for time trends and clustering.

#### 7.2.3 Subgroup and Exploratory Analyses

- Stratification by baseline overdose rate (high vs. medium)
- Examination of dose-response relationships (implementation metrics vs. outcomes)
- Assessment of temporal effects (immediate vs. delayed impact)
- Exploration of community characteristics that moderate effectiveness
- Evaluation of specific implementation factors associated with outcomes

#### 7.2.4 Economic Analysis

Cost-effectiveness analysis will calculate:
- Program costs (staff, supplies, overhead)
- Healthcare utilization costs (averted ED visits, hospitalizations)
- Productivity costs (lost productivity due to overdose)
- QALYs gained through averted deaths and improved health
- Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per QALY gained)

### 7.3 Missing Data

Multiple imputation will be used to address missing data under the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of different missing data assumptions on the primary outcome analysis.

## 8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 8.1 Human Subjects Protection

The study protocol will be reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (IRB) and relevant partner organization IRBs. The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

### 8.2 Informed Consent

#### 8.2.1 Program Participation

- Most intervention components (OEND, mobile outreach, community education) will be available to all community members without formal consent procedures, as they represent minimal-risk public health interventions.
- Components involving more intensive engagement (MOUD, peer support) will use verbal consent processes appropriate for the target population.
- Post-overdose outreach will use opt-out consent processes, given the urgent public health need and minimal risk.

#### 8.2.2 Research Activities

- Community surveys will obtain written informed consent from all participants.
- Administrative data will be used under appropriate data use agreements and with IRB approval for waiver of individual consent.
- Program data will be collected as part of routine service delivery, with notice to participants about evaluation.

### 8.3 Confidentiality

All data will be managed in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. Specific protections include:
- Secure data storage systems with access controls
- Removal of identifiers from analytic datasets
- Staff training on confidentiality procedures
- Certificate of Confidentiality from NIH
- Compliance with 42 CFR Part 2 for substance use treatment records

### 8.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment

#### 8.4.1 Potential Risks

- Privacy risks related to collection of sensitive information
- Potential for distress during discussions of overdose and addiction
- Minimal risks associated with standard harm reduction and treatment approaches

#### 8.4.2 Risk Mitigation

- Robust data security procedures
- Staff training in trauma-informed approaches
- Clear protocols for addressing distress or crisis
- Continual monitoring for adverse events

#### 8.4.3 Potential Benefits

- Reduced risk of fatal and non-fatal overdose
- Increased access to evidence-based treatment
- Improved community knowledge and reduced stigma
- Better coordination of care for high-risk individuals

The potential benefits of this public health intervention substantially outweigh the minimal risks.
