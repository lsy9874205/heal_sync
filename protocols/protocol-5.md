## 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### 1.1 Background

Orthopedic surgeries, particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA), are associated with moderate to severe post-operative pain. Traditionally, post-surgical pain management has relied heavily on opioid analgesics. While effective for short-term pain relief, opioids are associated with numerous adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, sedation, constipation, urinary retention, and risk of dependence or addiction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 6% of patients who receive opioids for post-surgical pain continue to use them one year later, contributing to the ongoing opioid epidemic.

Multimodal analgesia involves the use of multiple analgesic medications or techniques that target different mechanisms of pain, potentially providing more effective pain relief with fewer adverse effects compared to opioid monotherapy. Components of multimodal analgesia include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), gabapentinoids, regional anesthesia techniques, and non-pharmacological approaches.

### 1.2 Preliminary Data

Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of multimodal pain management approaches in orthopedic surgery. A retrospective analysis at our institution of 150 TKA patients receiving either standard opioid-based pain management or a preliminary version of our multimodal protocol showed:

- Reduced pain scores (mean difference: 1.8 points on 0-10 NRS, p<0.01)
- 45% reduction in opioid consumption (p<0.001)
- Earlier ambulation (mean difference: 6.2 hours, p<0.01)
- Shorter length of stay (mean difference: 0.7 days, p<0.05)
- Higher patient satisfaction scores (mean difference: 12.3 points on 0-100 scale, p<0.01)
- Lower incidence of opioid-related adverse events (32% vs. 48%, p<0.05)

However, this retrospective analysis had limitations including potential selection bias, absence of randomization, and inconsistent protocol adherence. A prospective, randomized controlled trial is needed to definitively establish the efficacy and safety of a standardized multimodal non-opioid analgesic protocol.

### 1.3 Rationale

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a comprehensive multimodal non-opioid analgesic protocol compared to standard opioid-based pain management for patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty. We hypothesize that the multimodal protocol will provide equivalent or superior pain relief while significantly reducing opioid consumption and opioid-related adverse events.

The NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative has identified the development and implementation of effective non-opioid pain management strategies as a key priority in addressing the opioid crisis. This study aligns with this priority by evaluating a practical, reproducible multimodal protocol that could be widely implemented if proven effective.

If successful, this protocol could significantly reduce post-surgical opioid exposure, potentially decreasing the risk of long-term opioid use, while maintaining or improving pain control and functional outcomes. The inclusion of a cost-effectiveness analysis will provide valuable information for healthcare systems considering implementation of similar protocols.

## 2. OBJECTIVES

### 2.1 Primary Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal non-opioid analgesic protocol compared to standard opioid-based pain management for post-surgical pain following total knee or hip arthroplasty, as measured by average pain scores during the first 48 hours post-surgery.

### 2.2 Secondary Objectives

1. To compare opioid consumption between the multimodal non-opioid protocol and standard opioid-based pain management
2. To assess functional recovery (time to ambulation, length of hospital stay) between treatment groups
3. To evaluate patient satisfaction with pain management between treatment groups
4. To assess the incidence of opioid-related adverse events between treatment groups
5. To determine the risk of persistent opioid use (at 3 months post-surgery) between treatment groups
6. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the multimodal non-opioid protocol compared to standard opioid-based pain management

### 2.3 Exploratory Objectives

1. To identify patient characteristics that predict response to the multimodal non-opioid protocol
2. To evaluate the impact of the multimodal non-opioid protocol on sleep quality during hospitalization
3. To assess the relationship between pre-operative pain catastrophizing and post-operative pain outcomes
4. To evaluate the impact of the multimodal non-opioid protocol on post-operative cognitive function in patients over 65 years of age

## 3. STUDY DESIGN

### 3.1 Overall Design

This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial comparing a multimodal non-opioid analgesic protocol to standard opioid-based pain management in patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). A total of 400 patients (200 per arm) will be enrolled at the University of Michigan Health System.

### 3.2 Study Population

The study population will consist of 400 adult patients scheduled to undergo elective primary TKA or THA at the University of Michigan Health System.

### 3.3. Randomization and Blinding

Eligible patients who have provided informed consent will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either standard opioid-based pain management (control arm) or the multimodal non-opioid analgesic protocol (intervention arm). Randomization will be stratified by:
- Procedure type (TKA vs. THA)
- Age (<65 vs. ≥65 years)
- Pre-operative opioid use (yes vs. no)

Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random allocation sequence with permuted blocks of varying sizes (2, 4, and 6) to ensure balance between groups. The allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician and implemented through a secure web-based randomization system.

Due to the nature of the interventions, complete blinding of patients and treating clinicians is not feasible. However, the following measures will be implemented to minimize bias:
- Outcome assessors collecting pain scores and other outcome data will be blinded to treatment assignment
- Patients will not be informed of specific hypotheses regarding the superiority of either approach
- Data analysts will be blinded to treatment assignment during analysis

### 3.4 Study Duration

The total duration of the study will be 24 months:
- Enrollment period: 18 months
- Follow-up period: 6 months after the last enrolled patient
- Each patient will participate for approximately 3 months (from pre-operative assessment to final follow-up visit)

## 6. STATISTICAL PLAN

### 6.1 Sample Size Determination

The primary outcome is the average pain score (NRS, 0-10) during the first 48 hours post-surgery. Based on previous studies, we consider a difference of 1.0 point on the NRS to be clinically significant. With an expected standard deviation of 2.5, 190 patients per group would provide 90% power to detect this difference using a two-sided t-test with alpha=0.05. To account for an anticipated 5% dropout rate, we will enroll 200 patients per group (400 total).

### 6.2 Statistical Analysis

#### 6.2.1 Analysis Populations

- Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: All randomized patients
- Per-protocol (PP) population: Patients who received their assigned treatment and had no major protocol deviations
- Safety population: All patients who received any study treatment

#### 6.2.2 Primary Outcome Analysis

The primary outcome (average pain score during the first 48 hours) will be compared between groups using a linear mixed-effects model with fixed effects for treatment group, time, treatment-by-time interaction, and stratification factors (procedure type, age, pre-operative opioid use). A random effect for patient will be included to account for repeated measurements. The primary analysis will be based on the ITT population.

#### 6.2.3 Secondary Outcome Analyses

1. Total opioid consumption will be compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test due to anticipated non-normal distribution.

2. Time to ambulation and length of hospital stay will be compared using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves.

3. Patient satisfaction and quality of life measures will be compared using linear regression models adjusted for stratification factors.

4. The incidence of opioid-related adverse events will be compared using chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate.

5. The percentage of patients with persistent opioid use at 3 months will be compared using logistic regression adjusted for stratification factors.

6. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the difference in total costs divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between the two groups.

#### 6.2.4 Exploratory Analyses

1. Subgroup analyses will be performed to identify patient characteristics associated with differential treatment response, including:
   - Procedure type (TKA vs. THA)
   - Age (<65 vs. ≥65 years)
   - Sex
   - Pre-operative opioid use
   - Pre-operative pain catastrophizing score
   - Anesthesia type (general vs. spinal)

2. The relationship between pre-operative pain catastrophizing and post-operative pain outcomes will be assessed using correlation and regression analyses.

3. The impact of the multimodal protocol on sleep quality and post-operative cognitive function will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.

#### 6.2.5 Interim Analysis

No formal interim analysis for efficacy is planned. Safety data will be monitored continuously throughout the study.

#### 6.2.6 Handling of Missing Data

Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of results to different missing data assumptions.

## 7. SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS

### 7.1 Definitions

#### 7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)

Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.

#### 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)

Any adverse event that:
- Results in death
- Is life-threatening
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
- Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
- Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above

### 7.2 Reporting Procedures

#### 7.2.1 AE Reporting

All AEs will be recorded in the study database. For each AE, the following information will be collected:
- Description of the event
