## 1. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE

### 1.1 Background

Chronic pain affects approximately 50 million adults in the United States, with 19.6 million experiencing high-impact chronic pain that interferes with daily life and work activities. Prescription opioids have been widely used for chronic pain management, but their long-term efficacy is limited, and they are associated with significant risks including tolerance, physical dependence, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, misuse, addiction, and overdose. The opioid epidemic has highlighted the urgent need for safe, effective non-pharmacological approaches to chronic pain management and strategies to reduce opioid use while maintaining or improving pain control and function.

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged as promising approaches for chronic pain management. Mindfulness involves paying attention to present-moment experiences with an attitude of openness, curiosity, and acceptance. MBIs typically combine mindfulness meditation practices with cognitive and behavioral strategies to enhance awareness of sensory, cognitive, and emotional aspects of pain, cultivate non-judgmental acceptance of pain, and reduce reactive patterns that may exacerbate suffering.

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have provided evidence for the efficacy of MBIs in reducing pain intensity, improving function, and enhancing emotional well-being among patients with chronic pain. However, most studies have not specifically addressed the use of MBIs for patients with chronic pain who are on long-term opioid therapy, nor have they examined whether MBIs can facilitate opioid dose reduction. This represents a critical gap in the literature, as effective non-pharmacological approaches are urgently needed to support opioid dose reduction while maintaining pain control and quality of life.

### 1.2 Preclinical and Clinical Data

#### 1.2.1 Preclinical Studies

Preclinical research has elucidated several mechanisms by which mindfulness practice may influence pain processing and opioid requirements:

- **Endogenous Opioid System**: Mindfulness meditation activates endogenous opioid pathways, as evidenced by studies showing that naloxone (an opioid antagonist) partially blocks meditation-induced analgesia.

- **Descending Pain Modulation**: Mindfulness practice enhances activity in brain regions involved in descending pain inhibition, including the anterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray.

- **Neuroplasticity**: Regular mindfulness practice is associated with structural and functional changes in brain regions involved in pain processing, attention, and emotional regulation.

- **Stress Response**: Mindfulness reduces stress reactivity and cortisol levels, which may indirectly reduce pain sensitivity and improve coping.

#### 1.2.2 Clinical Studies

Several clinical studies have examined the effects of MBIs on chronic pain outcomes:

- **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)**: Meta-analyses have shown moderate effect sizes for MBSR in reducing pain intensity (d = 0.33) and improving physical functioning (d = 0.38) in patients with chronic pain.

- **Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)**: Adapted for chronic pain, MBCT has shown efficacy in reducing pain catastrophizing, pain-related distress, and improving quality of life.

- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**: While not exclusively mindfulness-based, ACT incorporates mindfulness principles and has demonstrated efficacy in improving functioning and reducing distress in chronic pain.

However, few studies have specifically examined the effects of MBIs on opioid use in patients with chronic pain:

- A pilot study by Gardner-Nix et al. (2014) found that a 13-week mindfulness-based pain management program was associated with reductions in opioid doses among patients with chronic non-cancer pain.

- Garland et al. (2020) reported that Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) led to significant reductions in opioid dose and misuse risk compared to a support group control in patients with chronic pain on long-term opioid therapy.

- A small study by Young et al. (2018) found that an 8-week mindfulness program plus gradual opioid tapering resulted in greater dose reductions than tapering alone, with no worsening of pain intensity.

These promising findings suggest that mindfulness-based approaches may be valuable in supporting opioid dose reduction, but larger studies with longer follow-up periods and active control conditions are needed.

### 1.3 Rationale for Current Study

This study aims to address several key gaps in the existing literature:

1. **Targeted Intervention**: Most previous MBIs for chronic pain were not specifically designed to address issues related to opioid use and reduction. Our Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Chronic Pain (MBI-CP) specifically incorporates components addressing opioid-related concerns, including opioid-induced hyperalgesia, withdrawal symptoms, and craving.

2. **Adequate Control Condition**: Many previous studies used waitlist or treatment-as-usual controls, which do not account for non-specific effects of group intervention. Our study includes an active control condition (Pain Education Control) that controls for time, attention, group support, and expectancy effects.

3. **Pragmatic Design**: Most previous studies employed highly controlled efficacy designs that may limit generalizability. Our pragmatic design includes a heterogeneous patient population, flexible delivery methods, and clinically relevant outcomes.

4. **Longer Follow-up**: Most studies had relatively short follow-up periods. Our 12-month follow-up will provide valuable data on the durability of effects.

5. **Integration with Clinical Care**: Our intervention is designed to be integrated with patients' ongoing clinical care, including collaborative work with prescribing clinicians on opioid dose reduction.

The NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative has identified the development and evaluation of non-pharmacological approaches to pain management and opioid reduction as key priorities. This study directly addresses these priorities by testing a mindfulness-based approach that could be scaled up and implemented in diverse healthcare settings if proven effective.

### 1.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment

#### 1.4.1 Known Potential Risks

- **Psychological Discomfort**: Participants may experience temporary increases in emotional distress when paying mindful attention to pain sensations or difficult emotions.

- **Opioid Reduction Risks**: Opioid dose reduction may be associated with withdrawal symptoms, temporary increases in pain, anxiety, or insomnia.

- **Time Commitment**: Participation requires a significant time commitment, which may impose a burden on some participants.

#### 1.4.2 Known Potential Benefits

- **Reduced Opioid Use**: Participants may achieve meaningful reductions in opioid doses, potentially reducing risks associated with long-term opioid therapy.

- **Improved Pain Management**: Participants may develop enhanced skills for managing pain using non-pharmacological approaches.

- **Enhanced Functioning**: Improved ability to engage in valued activities despite pain.

- **Psychological Well-being**: Reduced distress, anxiety, and depression related to chronic pain.

#### 1.4.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits

The potential benefits of this study substantially outweigh the potential risks. The interventions are non-invasive behavioral approaches with minimal risks. The opioid dose reduction component will be conducted in collaboration with participants' prescribing clinicians, following established guidelines for safe tapering, and with careful monitoring for adverse effects. All participants will continue to receive standard medical care throughout the study.

## 3. STUDY DESIGN

### 3.1 Overall Design

This is a pragmatic, multi-site, randomized controlled trial comparing a Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Chronic Pain (MBI-CP) to a Pain Education Control (PEC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain who are on long-term opioid therapy. The study will enroll 300 participants across four clinical sites in Northern California, with 150 participants randomized to each arm. The randomization will be stratified by site and baseline opioid dose (20-50 MME vs. >50 MME daily).

The study includes a 12-week active intervention phase (8 weekly core sessions plus 4 monthly booster sessions) and a 9-month follow-up phase, for a total participant involvement of 12 months. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, mid-intervention (4 weeks), post-intervention (3 months), and follow-up points (6 and 12 months).

Both interventions will be delivered in group format, with 8-12 participants per group. Each site will run approximately 6-8 groups (3-4 per arm) over the course of the study. Groups will be led by trained facilitators with experience in mindfulness teaching (MBI-CP arm) or health education (PEC arm).

Throughout the study, participants will continue to receive usual medical care, including medication management, from their healthcare providers. Opioid tapering will be a collaborative process involving the study team, participants, and their prescribing clinicians.

### 3.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design

#### 3.2.1 Pragmatic Design Elements

This study employs a pragmatic design to enhance external validity and facilitate implementation in real-world settings:

- **Broad Eligibility Criteria**: Inclusion of patients with various pain conditions, comorbidities, and concomitant medications (within safety parameters).

- **Clinically Relevant Primary Outcome**: Focus on opioid dose reduction as the primary outcome, reflecting a key clinical priority in pain management.

- **Integration with Usual Care**: Interventions are designed to complement, not replace, participants' ongoing medical care.

- **Multiple Sites**: Inclusion of diverse clinical settings (academic medical center, integrated health system, VA healthcare system, and county hospital) to enhance generalizability.

#### 3.2.2 Control Condition

The Pain Education Control (PEC) condition was selected to control for non-specific factors such as group support, facilitator attention, and time commitment. This active control allows us to isolate the specific effects of mindfulness training beyond general education and support. The PEC provides valuable information about pain and its management but does not include training in mindfulness practices or other specific cognitive-behavioral skills.

#### 3.2.3 Stratification Factors

Randomization will be stratified by:

- **Site**: To account for potential site-specific variations in patient populations and care practices.

- **Baseline Opioid Dose**: Categorized as 20-50 MME vs. >50 MME daily, as baseline dose may influence the feasibility and magnitude of dose reduction.

### 3.3 Study Timeline

- **Months 1-6**: Study preparation (finalize protocols, train staff, set up databases)
- **Months 7-30**: Participant recruitment and enrollment
- **Months 9-42**: Intervention delivery
- **Months 12-48**: Follow-up assessments
- **Months 43-48**: Final data analysis and reporting

### 3.4 End of Study Definition

The primary endpoint of the study is the 6-month follow-up (9 months after randomization). The study will be considered complete when the last enrolled participant completes the 12-month follow-up assessment or withdraws from the study.

## 8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 8.1 Statistical Hypotheses

#### 8.1.1 Primary Hypothesis

H0: There is no difference between MBI-CP and PEC in percent change in daily opioid dose from baseline to 6 months.

H1: Participants in the MBI-CP group will achieve a greater percent reduction in daily opioid dose from baseline to 6 months compared to participants in the PEC group.

#### 8.1.2 Key Secondary Hypotheses

1. H0: There is no difference between MBI-CP and PEC in pain intensity (BPI) from baseline to 6 months.
   H1: Participants in the MBI-CP group will show greater reductions in pain intensity from baseline to 6 months compared to participants in the PEC group.

2. H0: There is no difference between MBI-CP and PEC in pain interference (BPI) from baseline to 6 months.
   H1: Participants in the MBI-CP group will show greater reductions in pain interference from baseline to 6 months compared to participants in the PEC group.

3. H0: There is no difference between MBI-CP and PEC in pain catastrophizing (PCS) from baseline to 6 months.
   H1: Participants in the MBI-CP group will show greater reductions in pain catastrophizing from baseline to 6 months compared to participants in the PEC group.

### 8.2 Sample Size Determination

The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome of percent change in daily opioid dose from baseline to 6 months. Based on previous studies, we anticipate that participants in the PEC group will achieve approximately 15% reduction in opioid dose, while those in the MBI-CP group will achieve approximately 30% reduction, with a standard deviation of 35% in both groups.

With these assumptions, a sample size of 118 participants per group will provide 85% power to detect this difference using a two-sided t-test with alpha=0.05. To account for an anticipated 20% attrition rate, we will enroll 150 participants per group (300 total).

This sample size will also provide adequate power (>80%) to detect clinically meaningful differences in key secondary outcomes, including:
- 1-point difference in BPI pain intensity (SD=2.0)
- 1-point difference in BPI pain interference (SD=2.2)
- 5-point difference in Pain Catastrophizing Scale (SD=10)

### 8.3 Populations for Analyses

#### 8.3.1 Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population

All randomized participants will be included in the ITT analysis, regardless of protocol adherence, intervention attendance, or study completion. The ITT analysis will be the primary approach for all efficacy analyses.

#### 8.3.2 Per-Protocol (PP) Population

Participants who attend at least 6 of 8 weekly sessions and complete all major assessments will be included in the PP analysis. The PP analysis will be conducted as a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome.

#### 8.3.3 Safety Population

All participants who attend at least one intervention session will be included in the safety analysis.

### 8.4 Statistical Analyses

#### 8.4.1 Primary Outcome Analysis

The primary analysis will compare percent change in daily opioid dose from baseline to 6 months between the MBI-CP and PEC groups using a linear mixed-effects model. The model will include fixed effects for treatment group, time, treatment-by-time interaction, and stratification factors (site and baseline opioid dose category). A random effect for subject will be included to account for within-subject correlation over time. The primary contrast of interest will be the between-group difference at 6 months.

#### 8.4.2 Secondary Outcome Analyses

Continuous secondary outcomes (e.g., pain intensity, pain interference, quality of life measures) will be analyzed using similar linear mixed-effects models.

Binary outcomes (e.g., achievement of ≥30% opioid dose reduction, PGIC improvement) will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with a logit link function.

Count outcomes (e.g., healthcare utilization) will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with a log link function.

All secondary analyses will use the same approach as the primary analysis, with appropriate transformations as needed to meet model assumptions.

#### 8.4.3 Exploratory Analyses

**Moderator Analyses**:
Potential moderators will be examined by including moderator-by-treatment interaction terms in the primary outcome model. Significant interactions will be followed by stratified analyses to understand differential treatment effects.

**Mediator Analyses**:
Potential mediators of treatment effects will be analyzed using structural equation modeling approaches. Models will test whether changes in proposed mediators (e.g., mindfulness, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance) account for treatment effects on the primary outcome.

**Dose-Response Analyses**:
For the MBI-CP group, the relationship between home practice (frequency and duration) and outcomes will be examined using correlation and regression analyses.

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**:
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated as the difference in costs between MBI-CP and PEC divided by the difference in QALYs. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to examine robustness of findings to various assumptions.

### 8.5 Handling of Missing Data

The primary analysis will use a mixed-effects model, which can accommodate missing data under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. To address potential bias from missing data, the following approaches will be used:

1. Multiple imputation for outcomes with substantial missing data (>10%)
2. Sensitivity analyses under different missing data assumptions
3. Pattern-mixture models if differential dropout is observed between treatment arms
4. Collection of reasons for dropout to inform missing data models

### 8.6 Interim Analyses

No formal interim analyses for efficacy are planned. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data at regular intervals and may recommend modifications to the study if safety concerns arise.
