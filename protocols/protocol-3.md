## PRÉCIS

This pragmatic, randomized clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) versus extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in primary care settings. The study will enroll 400 adults with OUD across 5 sites in the greater Seattle area, with participants randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either BUP-NX or XR-NTX for 24 weeks, along with medication management and supportive counseling. The primary outcome will be treatment retention at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include opioid use, opioid craving, withdrawal symptoms, pain severity, quality of life, and healthcare utilization. This study addresses a critical gap in knowledge regarding the comparative effectiveness of these two FDA-approved medications for OUD in real-world primary care settings and will inform clinical decision-making and policy development.

## 1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE

### 1.1 Public Health Impact of the Opioid Crisis

The United States continues to face an unprecedented opioid epidemic, with over 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurring in the 12 months ending in May 2022, the highest number ever recorded in a 12-month period. Opioids, particularly synthetic opioids (primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl), are currently the main driver of drug overdose deaths. The economic burden of the opioid crisis is estimated to exceed $1 trillion annually, including healthcare costs, lost productivity, criminal justice expenses, and other societal costs.

### 1.2 Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)

Three medications are FDA-approved for the treatment of OUD: methadone, buprenorphine (including the buprenorphine-naloxone combination), and naltrexone (oral and extended-release injectable formulations). These medications have been shown to reduce opioid use, opioid-related overdose deaths, criminal activity, and transmission of infectious diseases, while improving social functioning and retention in treatment.

#### 1.2.1 Buprenorphine-Naloxone (BUP-NX)

Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist that relieves opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings. It is most commonly prescribed in combination with naloxone (BUP-NX) to reduce the risk of misuse and diversion. BUP-NX can be prescribed by qualified healthcare providers in office-based settings under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000) and subsequent legislative changes. The combination is available as sublingual tablets or films, with typical maintenance doses ranging from 8-24 mg daily.

#### 1.2.2 Extended-Release Naltrexone (XR-NTX)

Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist that blocks the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is administered as a monthly intramuscular injection. Unlike BUP-NX, which can be initiated while a patient is still physically dependent on opioids, XR-NTX requires complete detoxification prior to initiation (typically 7-10 days opioid-free), which can present a significant barrier to treatment initiation.

### 1.3 Knowledge Gap and Study Rationale

Despite the availability of these treatment options, there is limited head-to-head data comparing the effectiveness of BUP-NX and XR-NTX in real-world clinical settings, particularly in primary care. The X:BOT study (Extended-Release Naltrexone vs Buprenorphine for Opioid Treatment) demonstrated superior treatment initiation and retention with BUP-NX compared to XR-NTX in inpatient settings, but comparable effectiveness once treatment was successfully initiated. However, this study did not specifically address treatment in primary care settings, where most patients with OUD receive care.

Primary care-based treatment of OUD has expanded significantly in recent years, with increasing emphasis on integrating addiction treatment into mainstream healthcare. Understanding the comparative effectiveness of BUP-NX and XR-NTX in primary care settings is therefore critical for informing clinical decision-making and policy development.

## 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES

### 2.1 Primary Objective

To compare the effectiveness of BUP-NX versus XR-NTX for the treatment of OUD in primary care settings, as measured by treatment retention at 24 weeks.

### 2.2 Secondary Objectives

1. To compare the effectiveness of BUP-NX versus XR-NTX on:
   - Self-reported opioid use and urine drug test results
   - Opioid craving and withdrawal symptoms
   - Pain severity and interference
   - Health-related quality of life
   - Healthcare utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations)
   - Non-fatal overdose events
   - HIV risk behaviors

2. To identify predictors of treatment success for each medication, including:
   - Demographic characteristics
   - Clinical characteristics (e.g., pain, psychiatric comorbidities)
   - Social determinants of health

3. To evaluate patient and provider experiences with each medication.

## 3. STUDY DESIGN

### 3.1 Overview

This is a pragmatic, randomized, open-label, comparative effectiveness trial of BUP-NX versus XR-NTX for the treatment of OUD in primary care settings. The study will enroll 400 adults with OUD across 5 sites in the greater Seattle area. Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either BUP-NX or XR-NTX for 24 weeks, along with medication management and supportive counseling. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, with a follow-up assessment at week 36.

### 3.2 Study Setting

The study will be conducted in 5 primary care clinics in the greater Seattle area, including academic medical centers, community health centers, and hospital-based primary care clinics. Each site has experience providing medications for OUD and has at least one provider with a DATA 2000 waiver to prescribe buprenorphine.

### 3.3 Participant Timeline

The study will consist of the following phases:
- Screening and baseline assessment: Up to 14 days
- Randomization and treatment initiation: Day 0

## 7. RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING

### 7.1 Randomization

Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either BUP-NX or XR-NTX using a computer-generated randomization sequence with permuted blocks of varying sizes. Randomization will be stratified by site and by opioid type (short-acting prescription opioids, heroin, or fentanyl as primary opioid of use).

### 7.2 Allocation Concealment

The randomization sequence will be generated by the study statistician and implemented using a secure, web-based randomization system. Treatment assignment will be concealed until after the participant has been enrolled and all baseline assessments have been completed.

### 7.3 Blinding

Due to the different routes of administration and the need for opioid detoxification prior to XR-NTX initiation, this will be an open-label study. Participants, providers, and research staff will not be blinded to treatment assignment. However, the statistical team conducting the final analysis will be blinded to treatment assignment until the analysis is complete.

## 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 9.1 Sample Size and Power

The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome of treatment retention at 24 weeks. Based on previous studies, we estimate that 60% of participants in the BUP-NX arm and 45% of participants in the XR-NTX arm will be retained in treatment at 24 weeks. With 200 participants per arm (400 total), the study will have 80% power to detect this difference with a two-sided alpha of 0.05, allowing for 15% loss to follow-up.

### 9.2 Analysis Populations

- Intention-to-treat (ITT) population: All randomized participants
- Per-protocol population: Participants who received at least one dose of study medication and completed at least one post-baseline assessment
- Safety population: All participants who received at least one dose of study medication

### 9.3 Statistical Analysis

#### 9.3.1 Primary Analysis

The primary analysis will compare treatment retention at 24 weeks between the BUP-NX and XR-NTX arms using a chi-square test in the ITT population. Participants lost to follow-up will be considered not retained in treatment. A logistic regression model will be used to adjust for site, opioid type, and other baseline characteristics.

#### 9.3.2 Secondary Analyses

1. Opioid use: Comparison of self-reported opioid use days and urine drug test results using appropriate statistical methods for repeated measures data.
2. Opioid craving and withdrawal: Comparison of SOWS and BSCS scores using linear mixed models.
3. Pain: Comparison of BPI scores using linear mixed models.
4. Quality of life: Comparison of EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 scores using linear mixed models.
5. Healthcare utilization: Comparison of emergency department visits and hospitalizations using negative binomial regression.
6. Non-fatal overdose events: Comparison of the proportion of participants with at least one non-fatal overdose event using chi-square tests.
7. HIV risk behaviors: Comparison of HRBS scores using linear mixed models.

#### 9.3.3 Exploratory Analyses

1. Identification of predictors of treatment success using logistic regression models.
2. Analysis of treatment satisfaction and provider satisfaction using descriptive statistics and qualitative methods.
3. Analysis of implementation outcomes using mixed methods.

### 9.4 Interim Analysis

An interim analysis will be conducted after 200 participants (50% of the planned sample) have completed the 24-week treatment phase or have been lost to follow-up. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the results of the interim analysis and make recommendations regarding the continuation of the study.

### 9.5 Handling of Missing Data

Multiple imputation will be used to handle missing data in the primary and secondary analyses. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results to different assumptions about missing data.

## 10. SAFETY MONITORING

### 10.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)

An independent DSMB will be established to monitor participant safety and study progress. The DSMB will include experts in addiction medicine, clinical trials, biostatistics, and ethics. The DSMB will review safety data at regular intervals and will make recommendations regarding the continuation, modification, or termination of the study.

### 10.2 Adverse Event Reporting

Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed at each study visit. The severity and relatedness to study medication of each AE will be determined by the investigator. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and the DSMB within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event.

### 10.3 Risk Mitigation

1. Participants will be monitored closely for signs of opioid withdrawal, overdose, and other adverse events.
2. Participants who discontinue study medication will be offered appropriate alternative treatment and will be encouraged to continue with study assessments.
3. All participants will receive education on overdose prevention and will be offered naloxone for overdose reversal.
4. Participants who experience significant psychiatric symptoms will be referred for appropriate mental health treatment.

## 11. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 11.1 Ethical Approval

The study protocol will be approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (IRB) and by the IRBs of all participating sites.
