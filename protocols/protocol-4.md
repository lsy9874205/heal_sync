## 1. ABSTRACT

**Background**: Chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) frequently co-occur, complicating treatment and creating significant challenges for both patients and providers. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy for both chronic pain and substance use disorders separately, but few interventions specifically target their co-occurrence. Digital health interventions offer the potential to increase access to evidence-based treatment for these complex patients.

**Objective**: This pragmatic randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel digital CBT intervention specifically designed for patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD, compared to enhanced usual care.

**Methods**: We will recruit 350 patients with chronic pain (pain lasting >3 months with moderate to severe intensity) who are also receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either: 1) a 12-week digital CBT program tailored for comorbid chronic pain and OUD plus usual care, or 2) enhanced usual care alone. The primary outcome will be pain interference as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include pain severity, opioid use, retention in MOUD treatment, depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.

**Significance**: This study will provide crucial evidence regarding the efficacy of a targeted digital CBT intervention for patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD, a vulnerable population with significant unmet treatment needs. If effective, this intervention could be rapidly scaled to increase access to evidence-based behavioral treatment for this complex patient population.

## 2. SPECIFIC AIMS

Chronic pain affects approximately 100 million Americans and represents one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been fueled in part by efforts to treat chronic pain with prescription opioids, resulting in a dramatic rise in opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose deaths. Current estimates suggest that 21-29% of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse them, and 8-12% develop an OUD. Conversely, up to 60% of individuals with OUD report co-occurring chronic pain, creating significant challenges for treatment.

While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy for both chronic pain and substance use disorders separately, few interventions have been developed to specifically address their co-occurrence. Furthermore, access to evidence-based behavioral treatments remains limited, particularly for vulnerable populations.

Digital health interventions have the potential to overcome barriers to care by providing accessible, scalable, and cost-effective treatment options. However, the efficacy of digital CBT interventions specifically targeting the unique needs of patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD has not been well-established.

This study aims to address this critical gap by evaluating a novel digital CBT intervention designed specifically for patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD. The specific aims of this study are:

**Aim 1**: To evaluate the efficacy of a 12-week digital CBT intervention, compared to enhanced usual care, in reducing pain interference among patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD who are receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD).

**Hypothesis 1**: Participants randomized to digital CBT will demonstrate greater reductions in pain interference at 12 weeks compared to those receiving enhanced usual care.

**Aim 2**: To evaluate the efficacy of the digital CBT intervention, compared to enhanced usual care, in improving secondary outcomes including pain severity, opioid use, retention in MOUD treatment, depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life.

**Hypothesis 2**: Participants randomized to digital CBT will demonstrate greater improvements in secondary outcomes at 12 weeks compared to those receiving enhanced usual care.

**Aim 3**: To identify baseline characteristics that moderate treatment response to the digital CBT intervention.

**Hypothesis 3**: Baseline pain characteristics (e.g., pain duration, pain severity), psychiatric comorbidity, and MOUD type will moderate treatment response.

**Aim 4**: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the digital CBT intervention compared to enhanced usual care.

**Hypothesis 4**: The digital CBT intervention will be cost-effective compared to enhanced usual care, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below the commonly accepted threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

## 3. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE

### 3.1 Chronic Pain and Opioid Use Disorder: A Complex Comorbidity

Chronic pain, defined as pain persisting for more than three months, affects approximately 100 million Americans and is associated with substantial disability, reduced quality of life, and high healthcare costs. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been fueled in part by efforts to treat chronic pain with prescription opioids. Between 21-29% of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse them, and 8-12% develop an opioid use disorder (OUD).

Conversely, up to 60% of individuals with OUD report co-occurring chronic pain, creating significant challenges for treatment. Patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD represent a vulnerable population with complex needs that are often inadequately addressed by current treatment approaches. These patients often report higher pain severity, greater functional impairment, more psychiatric comorbidity, and poorer treatment outcomes compared to those with either condition alone.

### 3.2 Treatment Approaches for Comorbid Chronic Pain and OUD

Current treatment approaches for comorbid chronic pain and OUD typically involve medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD, including methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) combined with multimodal pain management. However, evidence-based behavioral interventions specifically targeting this comorbidity are limited.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy for both chronic pain and substance use disorders when targeted separately. CBT for chronic pain focuses on developing adaptive coping strategies, reducing pain catastrophizing, increasing activity, and improving function. CBT for substance use disorders focuses on identifying and modifying thoughts and behaviors related to substance use, developing coping skills, and preventing relapse.

Integrating these approaches could potentially address the unique challenges faced by patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD. However, access to evidence-based behavioral treatments remains limited, particularly for vulnerable populations.

### 3.3 Digital Health Interventions for Chronic Pain and OUD

Digital health interventions have the potential to overcome barriers to care by providing accessible, scalable, and cost-effective treatment options. Several digital CBT programs for chronic pain have demonstrated efficacy in reducing pain interference, pain severity, and disability. Similarly, digital interventions for substance use disorders have shown promise in reducing substance use and supporting recovery.

However, the efficacy of digital CBT interventions specifically targeting the unique needs of patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD has not been well-established. This study aims to address this critical gap by evaluating a novel digital CBT intervention designed specifically for this population.

### 3.4 Significance and Innovation

This study is innovative in several ways:

1. It focuses on a vulnerable and understudied population with significant unmet treatment needs.
2. It evaluates a novel digital CBT intervention specifically designed to address the unique challenges of comorbid chronic pain and OUD.
3. It employs a pragmatic design that will enhance generalizability to real-world clinical settings.
4. It includes a cost-effectiveness analysis that will inform implementation decisions.

If effective, this intervention could be rapidly scaled to increase access to evidence-based behavioral treatment for this complex patient population, potentially reducing pain, improving function, supporting recovery from OUD, and enhancing quality of life.

## 4. PRELIMINARY STUDIES

Our research team has conducted several studies that provide the foundation for the proposed research:

### 4.1 Development of the Digital CBT Intervention

We conducted a mixed-methods study to develop the digital CBT intervention for comorbid chronic pain and OUD. This included:

1. **Formative Research**: We conducted focus groups and interviews with patients (n=32) and providers (n=18) to identify unique challenges and treatment needs.

2. **Intervention Development**: Based on formative research, we developed a digital CBT intervention that integrates evidence-based approaches for chronic pain and OUD. The intervention includes modules on pain education, cognitive restructuring, activity pacing, relaxation skills, coping with cravings, relapse prevention, and lifestyle modifications.

3. **Usability Testing**: We conducted usability testing with 12 patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD, which informed iterative refinements to the intervention.

### 4.2 Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial

We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=60) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the digital CBT intervention compared to enhanced usual care. Key findings included:

1. **Feasibility**: Recruitment targets were met, with 87% retention at 12 weeks.
2. **Acceptability**: Participants in the digital CBT group completed an average of 8.2 out of 12 modules, and 85% rated the intervention as helpful or very helpful.
3. **Preliminary Efficacy**: The digital CBT group demonstrated greater reductions in pain interference (effect size d=0.68, p=0.02) and pain severity (effect size d=0.52, p=0.04) compared to enhanced usual care at 12 weeks.

These promising findings support the conduct of a fully-powered randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the digital CBT intervention.

## 5. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

### 5.1 Study Design

This is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-week digital CBT intervention plus usual care to enhanced usual care alone for patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD who are receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of the two study arms and followed for 24 weeks. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.

### 5.2 Participant Eligibility

#### 5.2.1 Inclusion Criteria

1. Age 18 years or older
2. Chronic pain (pain lasting >3 months) with moderate to severe intensity (Brief Pain Inventory average pain severity score ≥4)
3. Current diagnosis of OUD based on DSM-5 criteria
4. Currently receiving MOUD (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) for at least 4 weeks
5. Ability to read and understand English
6. Access to a smartphone, tablet, or computer with internet connectivity
7. Willing and able to provide informed consent

#### 5.2.2 Exclusion Criteria

1. Active suicidal ideation with intent or plan
2. Unstable psychiatric condition that would interfere with participation (e.g., acute psychosis, severe cognitive impairment)
3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding
4. Current participation in another pain or substance use intervention study
5. Pain due exclusively to cancer or requiring imminent surgery

### 5.3 Recruitment, Screening, and Enrollment

Participants will be recruited from MOUD clinics (methadone clinics and office-based buprenorphine programs) and pain clinics at four sites: Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Rush University Medical Center, University of Illinois Hospital, and Jesse Brown VA Medical Center.

Potential participants will be identified through:
1. Provider referrals
2. Flyers and brochures in clinic waiting areas
3. Electronic health record screening (with waiver of authorization)
4. Self-referral through study website or phone line

Interested individuals will complete an initial screening by phone or in person to assess basic eligibility. Those who pass the initial screening will be scheduled for an in-person or telehealth baseline assessment to confirm eligibility, obtain informed consent, and collect baseline data.

### 5.4 Randomization

Eligible participants who provide informed consent will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either digital CBT plus usual care or enhanced usual care alone. Randomization will be stratified by:
1. MOUD type (methadone vs. buprenorphine vs. naltrexone)
2. Pain severity (moderate [BPI 4-6] vs. severe [BPI 7-10])

Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated sequence with permuted blocks of varying sizes (2, 4, and 6) to ensure balance between groups. The randomization sequence will be generated by the study statistician and implemented through a secure web-based system. Due to the nature of the intervention, participants and study staff cannot be blinded to treatment assignment. However, outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment assignment.

5. Monthly check-in calls from research staff to maintain engagement and collect data on healthcare utilization

### 5.6 Outcome Measures

#### 5.6.1 Primary Outcome

The primary outcome will be pain interference as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Pain Interference subscale at 12 weeks. The BPI Pain Interference subscale assesses the impact of pain on seven domains of functioning: general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Each item is rated on a 0-10 scale, with higher scores indicating greater interference. The BPI has been validated in patients with chronic pain and has demonstrated sensitivity to change in previous intervention studies.

#### 5.6.2 Secondary Outcomes

1. **Pain Severity**: BPI Pain Severity subscale (average of four items: worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now)

2. **Opioid Use**:
   - Self-reported illicit opioid use in the past 30 days (Timeline Followback)
   - Urine drug testing for opioids (excluding prescribed MOUD)

3. **MOUD Treatment Retention**:
   - Confirmed attendance at MOUD clinic visits or prescription refills

4. **Depression and Anxiety**:
   - Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression
   - Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety

5. **Pain Catastrophizing**:
   - Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)

6. **Pain Coping**:
   - Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)

7. **Health-Related Quality of Life**:
   - EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L)

8. **Global Impression of Change**:
   - Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)

9. **Healthcare Utilization**:
   - Emergency department visits
   - Hospitalizations
   - Outpatient visits
   - Medication use

10. **Cost-Effectiveness**:
    - Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from EQ-5D-5L
    - Direct medical costs
    - Productivity costs

#### 5.6.3 Implementation Outcomes

   - Number of modules completed
   - Time spent in program
   - Frequency of logins
   - Completion of exercises and homework

2. **Satisfaction**:
   - Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8)
   - System Usability Scale (SUS)
   - Qualitative interviews with a subset of participants (n=30)

#### 5.6.4 Potential Moderators

1. **Baseline Demographics**:
   - Age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income

2. **Pain Characteristics**:
   - Pain duration
   - Pain type (neuropathic, nociceptive, mixed)
   - Pain location

3. **Substance Use History**:
   - Duration of OUD
   - Route of administration
   - Other substance use

4. **MOUD Type**:
   - Methadone
   - Buprenorphine
   - Naltrexone

5. **Psychiatric Comorbidity**:
   - Baseline depression and anxiety severity
   - PTSD symptoms (PCL-5)

### 5.7 Sample Size and Power

The primary outcome is the BPI Pain Interference score at 12 weeks. Based on our pilot data and previous studies of CBT for chronic pain, we anticipate a moderate effect size of d=0.40. With 80% power, a two-sided alpha of 0.05, and accounting for up to 20% attrition, we will need to enroll 350 participants (175 per arm).

This sample size will also provide adequate power to detect clinically meaningful differences in key secondary outcomes, including a 30% reduction in illicit opioid use days and a 3-point difference in the PHQ-9.

### 5.8 Data Collection

#### 5.8.1 Assessment Schedule

Assessments will be conducted at the following time points:
- Baseline (pre-randomization)
- 6 weeks (mid-intervention)
- 12 weeks (post-intervention)
- 24 weeks (follow-up)

#### 5.8.2 Data Collection Methods

1. **Self-report measures**: Participants will complete self-report measures electronically using a secure web-based platform. Participants without internet access will have the option to complete measures by phone or in person.

2. **Urine drug testing**: Urine samples will be collected at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Samples will be tested for opioids, methadone, buprenorphine, cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and cannabis.

3. **MOUD treatment retention**: With participant consent, we will obtain records of MOUD clinic attendance or prescription refills.

4. **Healthcare utilization**: Self-reported healthcare utilization will be collected monthly using a structured questionnaire. With participant consent, we will also obtain medical records to validate self-reported healthcare utilization.

5. **Engagement with digital CBT**: For participants in the digital CBT arm, engagement data will be automatically recorded by the digital platform.

#### 5.8.3 Data Management

1. **Data Entry and Storage**: Data will be entered directly into a secure REDCap database. Data quality checks will be programmed into the database to minimize entry errors.

2. **Data Security**: All data will be stored on secure servers with appropriate firewalls and encryption. Personal identifiers will be stored separately from study data, with linkage available only to authorized study personnel.

3. **Quality Control**: Regular data quality checks will be performed by the data manager to identify missing data, outliers, or inconsistencies.

### 5.9 Statistical Analysis

#### 5.9.1 Primary Analysis

The primary analysis will compare BPI Pain Interference scores at 12 weeks between the digital CBT and enhanced usual care groups using a linear mixed-effects model. The model will include fixed effects for treatment group, time, treatment-by-time interaction, and randomization stratification factors (MOUD type and baseline pain severity). A random effect for participant will be included to account for within-subject correlation over time. The primary contrast of interest will be the difference between groups at 12 weeks.

#### 5.9.2 Secondary Analyses

1. **Continuous secondary outcomes** (e.g., pain severity, depression, anxiety) will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects models similar to the primary analysis.

2. **Binary secondary outcomes** (e.g., opioid use, MOUD retention) will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models with a logit link function.

3. **Count data** (e.g., number of healthcare visits) will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models with a log link function.

4. **Moderator analyses** will include interaction terms between treatment group and potential moderator variables in the mixed-effects models.

5. **Cost-effectiveness analysis** will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the difference in costs between the digital CBT and enhanced usual care groups, divided by the difference in QALYs. Bootstrapping will be used to estimate confidence intervals for the ICER.

#### 5.9.3 Handling of Missing Data

We will use multiple imputation to handle missing data under the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the results to different missing data assumptions, including missing not at random (MNAR) scenarios.

### 5.10 Data and Safety Monitoring

#### 5.10.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)

An independent DSMB will be established to monitor participant safety and study progress. The DSMB will include experts in pain medicine, addiction medicine, clinical trials, and biostatistics. The DSMB will meet every 6 months to review study progress, enrollment, retention, and adverse events.

#### 5.10.2 Adverse Events

Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed at each study visit and recorded in the study database. All SAEs will be reported to the IRB and DSMB within 24 hours of the study team becoming aware of the event. The relationship of each AE/SAE to the study intervention will be assessed by the principal investigator.

#### 5.10.3 Risk Mitigation

1. **Suicidal Ideation**: Participants reporting suicidal ideation on the PHQ-9 or during any study assessment will be immediately evaluated using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Those at imminent risk will be referred for immediate evaluation.

2. **Worsening Pain or Opioid Use**: Participants reporting significantly worsening pain or increased opioid use will be encouraged to contact their healthcare providers and will be provided with appropriate resources.

3. **Data Security**: Multiple layers of security will be implemented to protect participant data, including encryption, secure servers, and restricted access.

## 6. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION

### 6.1 Risks and Benefits

#### 6.1.1 Potential Risks

1. **Psychological Discomfort**: Participants may experience temporary psychological discomfort when discussing pain, opioid use, or related issues.

2. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: There is a risk of breach of confidentiality or privacy related to the collection of sensitive information about substance use and mental health.

3. **Time Burden**: Participation in the study requires time for completing assessments and, for those in the digital CBT arm, engaging with the intervention.

#### 6.1.2 Risk Mitigation

1. Study staff will be trained to respond appropriately to participant distress and provide resources as needed.

2. Robust data security measures will be implemented to protect participant confidentiality.

3. Participants will be informed of the time commitments before enrollment and will be compensated for their time.

#### 6.1.3 Potential Benefits

1. Participants may experience improvements in pain interference, pain severity, opioid use, and quality of life.

2. Participants in both arms will receive educational materials about chronic pain and OUD.

3. The study may generate knowledge that benefits future patients with comorbid chronic pain and OUD.

### 6.2 Informed Consent

Informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to any study procedures. The consent process will include a detailed explanation of the study purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives, confidentiality protections, and voluntary nature of participation. Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and will be given sufficient time to consider participation. The consent form will be written at an 8th-grade reading level and will be available in English and Spanish.

### 6.3 Confidentiality Protections

1. A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from NIH to protect research data from forced disclosure.

2. All data will be stored on secure servers with appropriate firewalls and encryption.

3. Personal identifiers will be stored separately from study data, with linkage available only to authorized study personnel.

4. All study staff will complete training in human subjects protection and data security.

### 6.4 Vulnerable Populations

Participants with OUD represent a vulnerable population. Special protections will include:

1. Emphasizing that participation is voluntary and will not affect their standard care or MOUD access.

2. Ensuring that consent procedures are non-coercive and participants fully understand study requirements.

3. Providing appropriate compensation for time and effort without creating undue inducement.

4. Implementing robust confidentiality protections given the stigma associated with both chronic pain and OUD.
