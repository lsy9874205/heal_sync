Chronic pain affects approximately 20-35% of children and adolescents worldwide, with 5-8% experiencing moderate to severe pain-related disability. Opioids are sometimes prescribed for selected adolescents with severe pain conditions, particularly those with cancer-related pain, sickle cell disease, or severe musculoskeletal pain. While opioids may provide effective short-term pain relief, their use in adolescents raises significant concerns due to the developing brain's vulnerability to substance use disorders and the risk of long-term consequences including opioid use disorder (OUD).

This study aims to evaluate a developmentally appropriate, multicomponent intervention designed to minimize opioid risks while providing effective pain management for adolescents with chronic pain. The intervention integrates evidence-based approaches to pain management, opioid risk mitigation, and prevention of substance use disorders, tailored specifically for adolescents and their families.

### 1.2 Background and Significance

#### 1.2.1 Adolescent Chronic Pain

Chronic pain, defined as pain lasting for three months or longer, is a significant health problem among adolescents. Common chronic pain conditions in this population include headache/migraine, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. Chronic pain in adolescence is associated with substantial functional disability, school absences, social isolation, sleep disturbance, and psychological comorbidities including depression and anxiety.

The management of chronic pain in adolescents typically involves a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy, psychological interventions, non-opioid medications, and in some cases, opioid analgesics. While guidelines generally recommend against long-term opioid therapy for non-cancer pain in children and adolescents, opioids may be prescribed for certain conditions or when other treatments have failed.

#### 1.2.2 Opioid Risks in Adolescence

Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period characterized by increased risk-taking, reward sensitivity, and vulnerability to substance use disorders. Key brain regions involved in executive function, impulse control, and reward processing continue to develop throughout adolescence and into early adulthood. Exposure to opioids during this sensitive period may disrupt normal neurodevelopment and increase susceptibility to substance use disorders.

Studies indicate that legitimate opioid prescriptions can be a pathway to problematic opioid use for some adolescents. A retrospective cohort study found that adolescents who received an opioid prescription had a 33% increased risk of opioid misuse later in life compared to those who never received a prescription. Additionally, approximately 3-5% of adolescents prescribed opioids for legitimate medical reasons develop problematic opioid use behaviors within one year.

Risk factors for problematic opioid use among adolescents with chronic pain include:
- Psychological factors (depression, anxiety, pain catastrophizing)
- History of substance use or substance use disorders
- Family history of substance use disorders
- Sleep disturbance
- Pain-related disability
- Limited pain coping skills
- Social isolation
- Environmental factors (peer substance use, access to opioids)

#### 1.2.3 Current Approaches to Opioid Risk Mitigation

Current approaches to mitigate opioid risks in adolescents with chronic pain include risk screening, opioid agreements, monitoring for concerning behaviors, urine drug testing, and prescription drug monitoring programs. However, these approaches are often implemented inconsistently, lack developmental appropriateness, and may not address the unique vulnerabilities of adolescents.

Moreover, while multiple evidence-based interventions exist for treating chronic pain in adolescents (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy) and for preventing substance use in general adolescent populations, few interventions specifically target the prevention of OUD in adolescents with chronic pain who are prescribed opioids.

### 1.3 Preliminary Studies

Our research team has conducted several studies that inform the current protocol:

1. **Risk Factors for Problematic Opioid Use in Adolescents with Chronic Pain**: A prospective cohort study of 250 adolescents with chronic pain prescribed opioids identified key risk factors for problematic opioid use, including depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, sleep disturbance, and baseline substance use. This study informed the selection of targets for our intervention.

2. **Development of the Current Opioid Misuse Measure - Adolescent Version (COMM-A)**: We adapted and validated the adult Current Opioid Misuse Measure for use with adolescents, creating a 15-item measure with good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84, test-retest reliability = 0.82, sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.78).

3. **Pilot Study of Multicomponent Risk-Reduction Intervention**: A pilot RCT with 60 adolescent-parent dyads demonstrated feasibility (92% retention) and acceptability (mean satisfaction rating 4.2/5) of the intervention. Preliminary efficacy data showed lower COMM-A scores in the intervention group compared to usual care at 6 months (mean difference: 3.4 points, p=0.03).

### 1.4 Rationale for Current Study

This multisite RCT builds on our preliminary work to test a comprehensive, developmentally appropriate intervention for preventing OUD in adolescents with chronic pain who receive opioid therapy. The intervention addresses modifiable risk factors for problematic opioid use through evidence-based approaches tailored for adolescents and their families. By targeting multiple risk domains (psychological, behavioral, social, and environmental), the intervention aims to reduce opioid risks while maintaining or improving pain management.

The NIH HEAL Initiative has identified the prevention of OUD as a key priority in addressing the opioid crisis. Adolescents represent a particularly vulnerable population, yet evidence-based prevention approaches specific to this group are limited. This study addresses this critical gap by testing an intervention that could potentially be scaled up and implemented across various clinical settings if proven effective.

## 3. STUDY DESIGN

### 3.1 Overall Study Design

This is a prospective, multisite, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms: Multicomponent Risk-Reduction Intervention (MC-RRI) and Enhanced Usual Care (EUC). The study will enroll 400 adolescent-parent dyads (200 per arm) across 8 pediatric pain centers in the United States. Participants will be followed for 18 months, including a 6-month intervention phase and a 12-month follow-up phase.

### 3.2 Study Timeline

- **Year 1**: Finalization of intervention materials, site training, regulatory approvals
- **Years 2-4**: Participant recruitment, enrollment, and intervention delivery
- **Year 5**: Completion of follow-up assessments, data analysis, and dissemination

### 3.3 Randomization

Eligible adolescent-parent dyads who provide informed consent/assent will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either MC-RRI or EUC using a computer-generated randomization sequence with permuted blocks of varying sizes. Randomization will be stratified by site and by primary pain condition (musculoskeletal, headache, abdominal, other).

The randomization process will be managed through a secure web-based system by the Data Coordinating Center at Columbia University. Due to the nature of the interventions, participants and interventionists cannot be blinded to treatment assignment. However, outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment.

## 8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 8.1 Sample Size and Power

The primary outcome is the COMM-A score at 6 months. Based on our pilot data, we anticipate a mean COMM-A score of 12.3 (SD=6.5) in the EUC group at 6 months. We consider a 30% reduction in COMM-A scores (3.7 points) to be clinically meaningful. With 160 adolescents per group completing the 6-month assessment (80% retention), we will have 90% power to detect a difference of 3.7 points or greater between groups using a two-sided t-test with alpha=0.05. To account for attrition, we will enroll 200 adolescent-parent dyads per group (400 total).

Secondary analyses will have adequate power to detect medium effect sizes (d=0.35-0.40) for continuous outcomes.

### 8.2 Analysis Plan

#### 8.2.1 Primary Analysis

The primary analysis will compare COMM-A scores at 6 months between the MC-RRI and EUC groups using an intention-to-treat approach. A linear mixed-effects model will be used with fixed effects for treatment group, time, site, pain condition, and treatment-by-time interaction. A random effect for participant will be included to account for repeated measures. The primary contrast of interest will be the difference between groups at 6 months.

#### 8.2.2 Secondary Analyses

Similar mixed-effects models will be used to analyze secondary continuous outcomes, including pain intensity, functional disability, quality of life, and psychological measures.

For binary outcomes (e.g., presence of problematic opioid use behaviors), generalized linear mixed models with a logit link function will be used.

Mediator analyses will use structural equation modeling to test whether changes in hypothesized mediators (e.g., pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, sleep) account for treatment effects on the primary outcome.

Moderator analyses will include interaction terms between treatment assignment and potential moderators (e.g., age, sex, pain condition) in the mixed-effects models.

#### 8.2.3 Economic Analysis

Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the difference in costs between MC-RRI and EUC divided by the difference in QALYs. Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of various assumptions on the ICER.

#### 8.2.4 Qualitative Analysis

Qualitative data from exit interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis. Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches. Themes will be identified and summarized to complement quantitative findings.

#### 8.2.5 Handling of Missing Data

Multiple imputation will be used to address missing data under the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of different missing data assumptions on the primary outcome analysis.

### 8.3 Interim Analyses

No formal interim analyses for efficacy are planned. However, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data at 6-month intervals and may recommend modifications to the study if safety concerns arise.

## PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS

**Title:** Preventing Opioid Use Disorder in Adolescents with Chronic Pain - A Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial

**Short Title:** PREVOPT-Adolescent Study

**Protocol Number:** HEAL-ADO-Pain-2023-01

**Phase:** N/A (Behavioral Intervention)

**Funding Source:** NIH HEAL Initiative (Helping to End Addiction Long-term)

**Primary Objective:** To evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent risk-reduction intervention compared to enhanced usual care in preventing problematic opioid use behaviors and opioid use disorder in adolescents with chronic pain who are prescribed opioid medications.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on pain intensity, pain-related functional disability, and quality of life.
2. To assess the impact of the intervention on opioid misuse risk factors, including pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance.
3. To identify moderators and mediators of intervention response.
4. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention relative to enhanced usual care.

**Study Design:** Prospective, multisite, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms.

**Study Population:** Adolescents aged 12-17 years with chronic pain conditions who are currently prescribed opioid medications or for whom opioid medications are being considered.

**Sample Size:** 400 adolescent-parent dyads (200 per arm)

**Study Duration:** 5 years (1 year development, 3 years enrollment, 1 year follow-up and analysis)

**Participant Duration:** 18 months (6-month intervention phase, 12-month follow-up phase)

**Intervention Groups:**
1. Multicomponent Risk-Reduction Intervention (MC-RRI)
2. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC)

**Primary Outcome:** Current Opioid Misuse Measure - Adolescent Version (COMM-A) score at 6 months

**Key Secondary Outcomes:**
1. Opioid risk behaviors at 6, 12, and 18 months
2. Pain intensity (Numerical Rating Scale)
3. Pain-related functional disability (Functional Disability Inventory)
4. Quality of life (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory)
5. Pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale for Children)
6. Depression and anxiety symptoms (PROMIS Pediatric)
7. Sleep disturbance (PROMIS Pediatric Sleep Disturbance)
8. Healthcare utilization and costs

**Statistical Methods:** Intent-to-treat analysis using mixed-effects models to account for repeated measures and site clustering.

## 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

### 1.1 Introduction

Chronic pain affects approximately 20-35% of children and adolescents worldwide, with 5-8% experiencing moderate to severe pain-related disability. Opioids are sometimes prescribed for selected adolescents with severe pain conditions, particularly those with cancer-related pain, sickle cell disease, or severe muscul
